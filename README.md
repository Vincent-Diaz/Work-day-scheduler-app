# Purpose
  The purpose of this project was to create a simple calendar application that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery with a polished UI.

# Description
  A Calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is the past, present, or future. When the save button for each timeblock is triggered, the text input for that event is saved in local storage. As a user with a busy schedule, I want the user to add important events to the daily planner, so they can manage their time more effectively.
